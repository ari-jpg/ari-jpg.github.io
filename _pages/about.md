Hi! My name is Arielle S. Joasil, and I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University's Department of Electrical Engineering. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christine P. Hendon](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/people/christine-p-hendon), who directs the [Structure Function Imaging Lab](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/). 

I received my MS and BS in Electrical Engineering from [UMass Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/engineering/electrical-computer/), where I was advised by [Dr. Kavitha Chandra](https://www.uml.edu/research/cact/people/chandra-kavitha.aspx) and [Dr. Charles Thompson](https://www.uml.edu/research/cact/people/thompson-charles.aspx) at the [CACT](https://www.uml.edu/research/cact/).  

In general, I'm interested in biomedical image processing. I use AI and signal processing techniques to extract meaningful information from optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes of the heart, breast, and uterus. One feature I've derived for this task is the attenuation coefficient, as shown in my [work (Joasil, Therien, and Hendon, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.30.1.016005), which differentiates the left atrium from the pulmonary vein. I showcase an implementation of the iterative attenuation algorithm described by [van Soest et al. (2010)](https://doi.org/10.1117/1.3280271)" in this [repository](https://github.com/ari-jpg/oct-attenuation-profile-pub). The full source code will be available via the Columbia Academic Commons (link coming soon).
