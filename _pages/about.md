Hi! My name is Arielle S. Joasil, and I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University's Department of Electrical Engineering. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christine P. Hendon](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/people/christine-p-hendon), who directs the [Structure Function Imaging Lab](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/). 

I received my MS and BS in Electrical Engineering from [UMass Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/engineering/electrical-computer/), where I was advised by [Dr. Kavitha Chandra](https://www.uml.edu/research/cact/people/chandra-kavitha.aspx) and [Dr. Charles Thompson](https://www.uml.edu/research/cact/people/thompson-charles.aspx) at the [CACT](https://www.uml.edu/research/cact/).  

In general, I'm interested in biomedical image processing. I use AI and signal processing techniques to extract meaningful information from optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes of the heart, breast, and uterus.
