Hi! My name is Arielle Joasil, and I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University's Department of Electrical Engineering. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Christine P. Hendon](https://structurefunctionlab.ee.columbia.edu/people/christine-p-hendon). I received my MS and BS in Electrical Engineering from [UMass Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/engineering/electrical-computer/).
